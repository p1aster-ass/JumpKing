# 🏰 Jump King ASM – Retro Platformer in x86 Assembly

Welcome to **Jump King ASM**, a retro-style vertical platformer built entirely in **x86 Assembly (TASM)**. Inspired by the punishing charm of *Jump King*, this project explores low-level graphics, physics, and keyboard input — all without a game engine.

## 🎮 Gameplay

You play as a tiny jumper trying to ascend a tall vertical level. There's **no walking**, **no checkpoints**, and **no forgiveness** — just your jump and gravity. One wrong move and you're falling... all the way down.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Language**: x86 Assembly (TASM)
- **Graphics Mode**: Mode 13h (320x200, 256 colors)
- **Tools**: Turbo Assembler (TASM), Turbo Linker (TLINK)
- **Emulation**: DOSBox
